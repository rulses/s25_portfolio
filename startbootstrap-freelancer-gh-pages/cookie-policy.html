    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 29, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Cookie Policy explains how Reed Ulses ("I", "me", or "my") uses
      cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit my
      website
      <em>[your domain, e.g., www.yourportfolio.com]</em>. It explains what
      these technologies are and why I use them.
    </p>

    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer,
      tablet, smartphone) when you visit a website. They help websites recognize
      your device, remember your preferences, and improve your experience.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>I use cookies for one purpose only:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Analytics and Performance:</strong> I use Google Analytics to
        collect information about how visitors use my website. This includes
        data like the pages you visit, how long you stay, how you arrived at the
        site, and your general geographic location (not your exact address).
        This information helps me understand how my website is used so I can
        improve it over time. Google Analytics may set cookies on your device to
        collect this information. The data collected is aggregated and anonymous
        â€” it does not identify you personally. You can learn more about how
        Google uses information from sites that use their services by visiting:
        <a
          href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a
        >.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings. Most
      browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. However, disabling cookies
      may impact how well my website functions for you. To opt out of Google
      Analytics tracking across all websites, you can install the Google
      Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on:
      <a
        href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      I may update this Cookie Policy from time to time. If I make significant
      changes, I will update the effective date at the top of this page.
    </p>
